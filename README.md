# BracketsBalance
These short programs check to see if the brackets in a string are balanced or not.
When running, these programs prompt user to type in a string with brackets 
and the program will check to see if those brackets contained in the string 
are balanced or not.
 
For example, In this string:     "{[()]}, {sdf[e()r]erq}"    brackets are balanced.
 
 And in this string:      "{[]}}[  }abc()"      brackets are not balanced.
   
 The 4 files are 4 implementations using C, C++, C# and Java.  It is interesting to compare them.
 The C++ and Java ones also implement an GUI version.
